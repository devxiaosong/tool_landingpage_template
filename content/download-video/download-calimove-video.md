Calimove is known for its professional fitness and calisthenics tutorial videos. Whether you're following a structured workout program or learning new movement skills, having offline access to these videos lets you train anywhere — even without an internet connection.

In this guide, we'll cover the two most reliable methods for downloading Calimove content.

## Method 1: iDownerGo Desktop App

iDownerGo is the most efficient solution for downloading Calimove content at full quality. Its built-in browser allows you to log into your Calimove account and download videos directly.

**Steps:**

1. Download and install iDownerGo on your Windows or Mac computer
2. Open iDownerGo — it includes a built-in browser
3. Navigate to **calimove.com** using the built-in browser
4. Log in to your Calimove account with your credentials
5. Find and play the video you want to download
6. iDownerGo automatically detects the video stream and adds it to the download queue
7. Click **Download All** to start the download process

**✅ Pros:**

- Downloads at original quality (up to 1080p)
- Built-in browser keeps your credentials secure
- Batch download — save multiple videos at once
- Supports MP4 and MKV output formats

**❌ Cons:**

- Requires software installation
- Free version limited to a set number of downloads

## Method 2: Screen Recording

If direct video stream detection isn't available for certain Calimove content, screen recording is a reliable fallback method that works for any video displayed on your screen.

**On Mac:**

1. Open **QuickTime Player**
2. Go to **File > New Screen Recording**
3. Click the record button and select your screen area
4. Play the Calimove video in full screen
5. Stop the recording when done — the file is saved as `.mov`

**On Windows:**

1. Press **Win + G** to open the **Xbox Game Bar**
2. Click the **Record** button (or press Win+Alt+R)
3. Play the Calimove video on screen
4. Press Win+Alt+R again to stop recording

Alternatively, **OBS Studio** (free, open source) provides more control over recording quality and file format on both Windows and Mac.

**✅ Pros:**

- Works for any video content on any website
- No special software required (on Mac)
- Free

**❌ Cons:**

- Video quality depends on your screen resolution
- Audio and video may not perfectly sync at times
- Real-time only — recording takes as long as the video plays

## Which Method is Best?

For the highest quality and most convenient experience, **iDownerGo** is the clear winner. It downloads the original video stream directly, giving you full quality without any screen recording artifacts.

**Screen recording** works as a universal backup when direct download isn't possible, but the quality won't match the original stream.

If you're a serious Calimove user who regularly saves workout videos for offline training, iDownerGo's batch download feature will save you significant time compared to recording each video individually.
