Extracting audio from an MP4 video is one of the most common media conversion tasks. Maybe you want to save a music video as an MP3 for your music player, pull a podcast recording out of a video interview, or archive a lecture for listening on the go.

Whatever the reason, here are 6 proven methods to get the job done.

## Method 1: iDownerGo — Best for Downloaded Videos

iDownerGo not only downloads videos but can also save audio-only in MP3 format, or convert existing MP4 files to MP3.

**To convert an existing MP4 file:**

1. Open iDownerGo and go to the **Convert** tab
2. Click **Add Files** and select your MP4 video
3. Choose **MP3** as the output format
4. Set your preferred bitrate: 128kbps, 192kbps, or 320kbps
5. Click **Convert Now**

**✅ Pros:** High bitrate output (up to 320kbps), batch conversion, fast processing

**❌ Cons:** Paid software for unlimited use

## Method 2: FFmpeg — Fastest Lossless Extraction

FFmpeg can extract the audio stream from an MP4 without re-encoding, preserving the original quality at nearly zero processing time.

**Direct audio stream copy (fastest, no quality loss):**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec copy output.aac
```

**Convert to MP3 with specific bitrate:**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k output.mp3
```

**Extract audio at highest possible quality:**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec libmp3lame -q:a 0 output.mp3
```

(`-q:a 0` uses variable bitrate at maximum quality)

**✅ Pros:** Lossless extraction possible, completely free, excellent for batch scripting

**❌ Cons:** Command-line only

## Method 3: VLC Media Player — Quick Audio Extraction

VLC's Convert feature works for audio extraction as well as video conversion.

**Steps:**

1. Open VLC → **Media > Convert/Save**
2. Add your MP4 file
3. Click **Convert/Save**
4. In the Profile dropdown, select **Audio - MP3**
5. Set the output path ending in `.mp3`
6. Click **Start**

**✅ Pros:** Free, cross-platform, no size limits

**❌ Cons:** Re-encodes the audio (slight quality reduction possible), no batch GUI

## Method 4: Audacity — Edit and Export Audio

If you want to edit the audio while converting, Audacity is the best free audio editor.

**Steps:**

1. Open Audacity and go to **File > Import > Audio**
2. Select your MP4 file (Audacity imports the audio track)
3. Edit as needed: trim, normalize, remove noise, etc.
4. Go to **File > Export > Export as MP3**
5. Set bitrate and save

**✅ Pros:** Powerful audio editing capabilities, free, open source

**❌ Cons:** Requires FFmpeg plugin to import MP4, slower for bulk tasks

## Method 5: iTunes / Apple Music — Simple on Mac

On Mac, you can use the built-in iTunes (or Music app in newer macOS) to convert MP4 audio.

**Steps:**

1. Add the MP4 file to your iTunes/Music library
2. Go to **Edit > Preferences > Import Settings** and select **MP3 Encoder**
3. Right-click the file in your library
4. Select **Create MP3 Version**
5. The MP3 version appears alongside the original in your library

**✅ Pros:** Built into macOS, simple clicks, no extra software

**❌ Cons:** Mac only, requires adding files to the library first, slow for batch operations

## Method 6: Online MP4 to MP3 Converter

Online tools are the easiest option for occasional use with smaller files.

**Popular options:** Online-Convert.com, MP3Converter.net, Convertio

**Steps:**

1. Visit an online audio converter
2. Upload your MP4 file
3. Select **MP3** as the output format
4. Choose bitrate (128kbps, 192kbps, or 320kbps)
5. Convert and download

**✅ Pros:** No installation, works on mobile and desktop

**❌ Cons:** File size limits (usually 100MB–1GB), slow uploads, privacy concerns

## Choosing the Right Bitrate

The MP3 bitrate determines audio quality and file size:

| Bitrate | Quality | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 128 kbps | Good | Casual listening, podcasts |
| 192 kbps | Very Good | Music, general use |
| 256 kbps | Excellent | Music, audiophiles |
| 320 kbps | Maximum MP3 | Studio quality, archiving |

For music, use at least 192kbps. For speech (podcasts, lectures), 128kbps is perfectly fine.

## Conclusion

For quick single-file conversions, **VLC** or an **online converter** work great. For the best quality and fastest processing without re-encoding, **FFmpeg** is the top choice. If you're regularly working with downloaded video content, **iDownerGo** offers the most streamlined experience combining download and audio extraction in one tool.
