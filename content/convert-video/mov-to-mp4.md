MOV is Apple's native video format, used by iPhones, QuickTime Player, and Final Cut Pro. While MOV files offer excellent quality, they're often much larger than MP4 files and aren't natively supported on Windows or most Android devices.

Converting MOV to MP4 is one of the most common video tasks, and there's no shortage of ways to do it. Here are 6 reliable methods.

## Method 1: iDownerGo — Best for Batch Conversion

iDownerGo supports converting MOV files to MP4 in bulk, making it the most efficient choice if you have multiple files to convert.

**Steps:**

1. Open iDownerGo and click the **Convert** tab
2. Drag and drop your MOV files (or click **Add Files**)
3. Select **MP4** as the output format
4. Choose output quality: Original, 1080p, 720p, or 480p
5. Click **Convert Now** and wait for the process to complete

**✅ Pros:** Fast batch conversion, hardware acceleration, high output quality, supports subtitle tracks

**❌ Cons:** Paid software for unlimited use, requires installation

## Method 2: QuickTime Player — Built-in Mac Tool

On a Mac, QuickTime Player can export MOV files as MP4 natively — no third-party software needed.

**Steps:**

1. Open your MOV file in QuickTime Player
2. Go to **File > Export As**
3. Select your desired resolution: **4K**, **1080p**, **720p**, or **480p**
4. In the save dialog, make sure the file name ends with `.mp4`
5. Click **Save**

**✅ Pros:** Built into macOS, no installation, simple and fast

**❌ Cons:** Mac only, limited codec control, can't batch convert

## Method 3: VLC Media Player — Free & Cross-Platform

VLC works on both Windows and Mac and handles MOV to MP4 conversion without any extra plugins.

**Steps:**

1. Open VLC → **Media > Convert/Save**
2. Click **Add** and select your MOV file
3. Click **Convert/Save**
4. In the Profile section, choose **Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)**
5. Set the output destination with `.mp4` extension
6. Click **Start**

**✅ Pros:** Free, no file size limits, cross-platform

**❌ Cons:** Slower than some alternatives, interface is not very intuitive for conversion

## Method 4: FFmpeg — Fast Command-Line Conversion

For users comfortable with the command line, FFmpeg provides the fastest MOV-to-MP4 conversion.

**Lossless remux (no re-encoding, fastest):**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c copy output.mp4
```

**Re-encode for maximum compatibility:**

```
ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

**Batch convert all MOV files in a folder (Mac/Linux):**

```
for f in *.mov; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -c copy "${f%.mov}.mp4"; done
```

**✅ Pros:** Lightning fast with copy mode, completely free, supports batch scripting

**❌ Cons:** Command-line only, not beginner-friendly

## Method 5: HandBrake — Best Quality Control

HandBrake is ideal when you need to reduce file size while maintaining good quality.

**Steps:**

1. Open HandBrake and drag your MOV file into the window
2. In the **Presets** panel on the right, choose a preset (e.g., "Fast 1080p30")
3. Make sure the Format is set to **MP4 File**
4. Adjust quality with the RF slider if needed
5. Set the output path and click **Start Encode**

**✅ Pros:** Excellent compression, free, hardware encoder support (NVENC, AMD VCE, Apple VideoToolbox)

**❌ Cons:** Slower than FFmpeg copy mode, re-encodes the video

## Method 6: Online Converter — No Software Required

For occasional conversions of smaller files, online tools are the quickest solution.

**Recommended tools:** CloudConvert, Convertio, Zamzar

**Steps:**

1. Go to the online converter website
2. Upload your MOV file
3. Select **MP4** as the output format
4. Click **Convert** and download the file

**✅ Pros:** No software needed, works on any OS and device

**❌ Cons:** Upload limits (free plans typically cap at 1GB), slower for large files, privacy concerns

## MOV vs MP4: File Size Comparison

Converting a typical 1-minute iPhone MOV file:

| Format | Typical File Size |
|--------|------------------|
| MOV (original) | ~180 MB |
| MP4 (H.264, copy) | ~175 MB |
| MP4 (H.264, re-encoded) | ~80–120 MB |
| MP4 (H.265/HEVC) | ~40–70 MB |

Re-encoding to H.264 or H.265 can dramatically reduce file size while maintaining great visual quality.

## Conclusion

For Mac users, **QuickTime Player** is the quickest no-fuss solution. Windows users should try **VLC** or **HandBrake**. Need to convert many files at once? **iDownerGo** handles batch processing efficiently. For technical users, **FFmpeg** is unbeatable in speed and flexibility.
