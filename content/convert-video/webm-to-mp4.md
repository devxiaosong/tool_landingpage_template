WebM is an open-source video format developed by Google, commonly used for HTML5 video playback on websites like YouTube (for streaming in Chrome). While WebM offers good compression, it has limited compatibility with many media players, editing software, and devices outside of web browsers.

Converting WebM to MP4 gives you a universally compatible file that plays everywhere. Here are 5 straightforward methods.

## Method 1: iDownerGo — Batch Convert with High Quality

iDownerGo makes it easy to convert WebM files to MP4, including batch processing for multiple files simultaneously.

**Steps:**

1. Launch iDownerGo and navigate to the **Convert** section
2. Click **Add Files** and select your WebM file(s)
3. Select **MP4** as the output format
4. Choose resolution (keep original for best quality)
5. Click **Convert Now**

**✅ Pros:** High-quality output, batch support, simple interface, hardware acceleration

**❌ Cons:** Free version limited to 3 conversions, requires installation

## Method 2: FFmpeg — Instant Command-Line Conversion

FFmpeg handles WebM to MP4 conversion perfectly. Since both formats use similar video codecs (VP9/H.264), conversion is fast and clean.

**Basic conversion:**

```
ffmpeg -i input.webm -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

**Keep original quality with CRF (recommended):**

```
ffmpeg -i input.webm -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.mp4
```

**For WebM with VP9 video — optimize the output:**

```
ffmpeg -i input.webm -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

**✅ Pros:** Free, excellent quality control, scriptable for batch conversion

**❌ Cons:** Command-line only, requires some technical knowledge

## Method 3: VLC Media Player — Easy Free Option

VLC supports WebM playback and conversion to MP4 without any extra plugins.

**Steps:**

1. Open VLC → **Media > Convert/Save** (Ctrl+R)
2. Click **Add** and choose your WebM file
3. Click the **Convert/Save** button
4. In the Profile dropdown, select **Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)**
5. Enter the output file path with `.mp4` extension
6. Click **Start**

**✅ Pros:** Free, available on Windows, Mac, and Linux

**❌ Cons:** Conversion is slower than FFmpeg, no batch processing in the GUI

## Method 4: HandBrake — Reduce File Size While Converting

If your WebM file is large, HandBrake lets you convert and compress it simultaneously.

**Steps:**

1. Open HandBrake and load your WebM file
2. Select a **Preset** from the right panel (e.g., "Fast 1080p30")
3. Ensure Format is set to **MP4 File**
4. Adjust the **RF Quality** slider (lower value = higher quality)
5. Set the output destination and click **Start Encode**

**✅ Pros:** Great compression, hardware acceleration, free

**❌ Cons:** Re-encodes the video (slower than stream copy), slight quality loss possible

## Method 5: Online Converter — Browser-Based, No Install

For single files under 1-2GB, online converters are the quickest option.

**Popular services:** CloudConvert, Convertio, Online-Convert.com

**Steps:**

1. Visit an online conversion website
2. Upload your WebM file
3. Choose **MP4** as the output format
4. Adjust quality settings if available
5. Click **Convert** and download the result

**✅ Pros:** No software installation, works on any device including mobile

**❌ Cons:** Upload size limits on free plans, potential privacy issues, depends on internet speed
